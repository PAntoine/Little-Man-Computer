LMC Instruction Set</h1>
The LMC has nine instructions.&nbsp; Each instruction has an assembly mnemonic
that is equivalent to a three-digit (decimal) instruction.&nbsp; In this
numerical instruction, the first digit usually represents the instruction,
and the second and third digits usually represent a mailbox address.
<p><a href="LMCInstructionSummary.html">Summary Table</a>
<h4>
LOAD</h4>
mnemonic - LDA
<br>numerical/machine code - 5
<p>Load the contents of the given mailbox onto the accumulator (calculator).&nbsp;
Note: the contents of the mailbox are not changed.
<h4>
STORE</h4>
mnemonic - STA
<br>numerical/machine code - 3
<p>Store the contents of the accumulator (calculator) to the mailbox of
the given address.&nbsp; Note: the contents of the accumulator are not
changed.
<h4>
ADD</h4>
mnemonic - ADD
<br>numerical/machine code - 1
<p>Add the contents of the given mailbox onto the accumulator (calculator).&nbsp;
Note: the contents of the mailbox are not changed, and the actions of the
accumulator are not defined for add instructions that cause sums larger
than 3 digits.
<h4>
SUBTRACT</h4>
mnemonic - SUB
<br>numerical/machine code - 2
<p>Subtract the contents of the given mailbox from the accumulator (calculator).&nbsp;
Note: the contents of the mailbox are not changed, and the actions of the
accumulator are not defined for subtract instructions that cause negative
results -- however, a negative flag will be set so that BRP can be used
properly (see below).
<h4>
INPUT</h4>
mnemonic - INP
<br>numerical/machine code - 901
<p>Copy the value from the "in box" onto the accumulator (calculator).
<h4>
OUTPUT</h4>
mnemonic - OUT
<br>numerical/machine code - 902
<p>Copy the value from the accumulator (calculator) to the "out box".&nbsp;
Note: the contents of the accumulator are not changed.
<h4>
END</h4>
mnemonic - HLT
<br>numerical/machine code - 000
<p>Causes the Little Man Computer to stop executing your program.
<h4>
BRANCH IF ZERO</h4>
mnemonic - BRZ
<br>numerical/machine code - 7
<p>If the contents of the accumulator (calculator) are 000, the PC (program
counter) will be set to the given address.&nbsp; Note: since the program
is stored in memory, data and program instructions all have the same address/location
format.
<h4>
BRANCH IF ZERO OR POSITIVE</h4>
mnemonic - BRP
<br>numerical/machine code - 8
<p>If the contents of the accumulator (calculator) are 000 or positive
(i.e. the negative flag is not set), the PC (program counter) will be set
to the given address.&nbsp; Note: since the program is stored in memory,
data and program instructions all have the same address/location format.
<h4>
BRANCH ALWAYS</h4>
mnemonic - BRA
<br>numerical/machine code - 6
<p>Set the contents of the accumulator (calculator) to the given address.&nbsp;
Note: since the program is stored in memory, data and program instructions
all have the same address/location format.
<h4>
DATA LOCATION</h4>
mnemonic - DAT
<br>numerical/machine code - (the data)
<p>When compiled, a program converts each instruction into a three-digit
code.&nbsp; These codes are placed in sequential mailboxes.&nbsp; Instead
of a program component, this instruction will reserve the next mailbox
for data storage.
